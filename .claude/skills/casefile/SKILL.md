name: casefile
description: Operate the casefile investigation log in this repo — resume context at session start, file hypotheses/decisions/observations with correct types and authors as you work, and translate the user's conversational directions ("where are we", "rule that out", "don't touch X", "have we seen this before") into casefile CLI calls.

# casefile — porcelain behavior (SPEC §11.2, §13)

The CLI is `python3 casefile.py <cmd>` from the repo root (or `casefile` if
installed). The log (`.casefile/log.jsonl`) is append-only ground truth —
**never edit it by hand**; corrections are new entries.

## Session start

1. Run `python3 casefile.py resume-context` and read it. Ground truth beats
   the notes: where the log and the world conflict, the world wins — record
   the discrepancy as a new observation.
2. Run `python3 casefile.py recheck --startup` — it re-runs the recorded
   check recipes and tells you which claims still hold versus
   held-three-days-ago. Drift is your first lead. `--startup` keeps this
   fast by skipping known-slow recipes (their last conclusive result is
   reported instead); run the bare `recheck` when a skipped claim matters.
3. Run `python3 casefile.py status`. Address open questions before
   proceeding; questions marked `→ user` are waiting on the user — surface
   them once, don't block on them. Act on any dormancy nudge or lint count
   conversationally (never dump raw lint output at the user).

## Filing conventions (types and authors matter — grades are computed from them)

- **hypothesis** — falsifiable claim, author is whoever proposed it. Add
  `--check '<shell>'` when a one-liner can test it (exit 0 = still holds).
- **decision** — author `user` ONLY for choices the user actually made;
  your own proposals are author `claude` (they render as "asserted, not
  user-confirmed"). Always give `--rationale`; record losing alternatives
  with `--rejected "option:reason"` so they aren't re-proposed.
- **observation** — ground truth only: test output, command results, log
  lines, with `--source`. Never file your own inference as an observation.
- **verify** — links a hypothesis to a real observation. Model agreement is
  never verification; endorse instead (`consensus` is explicitly weaker).
- **dispute** when you disagree with a recorded claim; `resolve` with
  `--outcome upheld|withdrawn|answered` when settled.
- **question --to user** for things only the user can answer (the mailbox).
- **digest** at checkpoints (`--kind judgment`), and keep the rolling
  abstract current (`--kind abstract`; `--supersedes` is automatic for
  abstracts): problem, status with grade in words, leading theory,
  ruled-out list, key decisions, open items. Run `reindex` after.

## Recognizing casefile-directed speech

| user says | you do |
|---|---|
| "where are we on X?" | `resume-context` → prose summary sized to the question |
| "don't touch X" | `add -t constraint -a user` |
| "I'm not convinced by X" | `dispute -a user` |
| "why did we rule out X?" | `dig "<query>"` (searches superseded history; expands digests) |
| "have we seen this before?" | `recall "<query>"` (searches past-case abstracts) |
| "what's codex saying?" / "show me the deliberation" | `channel <model>` (ui viewport → that model's live transcript) |
| "show the case again" | `channel state` (ui viewport → live state view) |
| "rule that out" / "let's go with X" | `resolve` / `add -t decision -a user` — **confirm first** |

## Trust conventions

- **Echo-back**: every mutation of the *user's* words echoes in one line:
  `recorded: constraint "don't touch the sniffer" (user)`. This is how
  mistranscription gets caught.
- **Confirm** destructive-ish acts (resolve, digest, revoke) with one word
  before running them. Reads never confirm.
- Your own routine filing is silent by default; show it on request.

## Importing existing notes (§11.3)

To bootstrap a case from a CLAUDE.md, notes file, or pasted scrollback:
extract typed entries into a JSONL draft — one
`{"type": …, "author": …, "body": …}` per line (decisions may carry
`rationale`/`rejected`; observations `source`; hypotheses/constraints
`check`; questions `to`) — show the user the draft for bulk confirmation,
then run `python3 casefile.py import <draft.jsonl>`. Validation is
all-or-nothing; each imported entry echoes.

## Proposing

- When a debugging/diagnosis conversation shows multi-window shape
  (reproduction attempts, competing theories, >1 hour of context) and no
  case is open, **propose** opening one; on "yes", open it and backfill via
  `import`. Before the first hypothesis, `recall` the problem statement —
  surface strong compost hits ("this resembles the March importer case…").
- When the differential stalls (two theories, no discriminating evidence,
  ~3 windows without progress), propose escalating to a spitball (once the
  driver exists — M4).
